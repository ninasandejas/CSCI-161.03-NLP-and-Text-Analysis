      "['Riskier than ever, SB19 releases new EP ‘Simula At Wakas’', 'https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/music/sb19-extended-play-simula-at-wakas/', '2025-04-25T20:55:04+08:00', \"MANILA, Philippines – A two-night concert in the world’s largest indoor arena, grander marketing executions, collaboration with international producers, mixing genres\\xa0— P-pop group SB19 took bolder moves as it released its new extended play “Simula At Wakas” on Friday, April 25.\\nIn an interview with Rappler, SB19 member Justin said every new release from the group seemed like a new beginning, as they’ve always said. But this time, the risks they took made all the difference. After the release of single “DAM,” all eyes are on them as fans anticipate five more songs from the EP.\\nAs the group’s main rapper Josh puts it, the EP has “different flavors and different scenarios” for different types of listeners. \\n“Kung hindi mo man-trip itong isang genre na ito, or hindi para sa’yo ito — kung ayaw mo ng maingay, ayaw mo ng tahimik, meron pa ring para sa iyo. May hip-hop, may rock, mayroong ballad,” he said.\\n(If you’re not a fan of one genre, if you feel like one genre is not for you — if you don’t like loud music, or sentimental music — there’s still something for you. There’s hip-hop, rock, there’s ballad.)\\nSB19 leader Pablo recommended tracks for certain moods. “Siguro kung mag-work out ka, pakinggan mo yung ‘8TonBall,’ ‘yung ‘DUNGKA!,’ ‘DAM,’ ‘yan pang-work out. Kung gusto mong mag-senti, after work, tapos madilim na, tahimik na, pakinggan nyo ‘yung ‘Time.’ Pakinggan nyo ‘yung ‘Quit.’ Hindi kayo magsisisi. Kung gusto mo lang ng feel-good vibe na parang nai-enjoy mo lahat ng bagay sa paligid mo or gusto mo travel, ‘Shooting for the Stars.’”\\n(If you’re working out, listen to “8TonBall,” “DUNGKA!,” “DAM.” Those songs are good for when you’re working out. If you feel sentimental, after work, when it’s dark and quiet, listen to “Time.” Listen to “Quit.” You won’t regret it. If you want a feel-good vibe when you want to enjoy the things happening around you, or when you’re traveling, listen to “Shooting for the Stars.”)\\nDelving deep into the group’s discography, it becomes clear the members are sharing parts of themselves through their songs, sharing vulnerability through the lyrics.\\nJosh revealed, “For me, it’s the highest form of art. I feel like, if di ka authentic, hindi ka true to yourself sa pinapakita mo in terms of everything you do. Kung itatago mo lang din lagi yung vulnerability mo, hindi na ikaw yun. Or if it’s not your story, I feel like, hindi na genuine, hindi makakarelate or hindi na natural.”\\n(For me, it’s the highest form of art. I feel like if you’re inauthentic, you’re not true to yourself in terms of everything you do. If you will hide your vulnerability, that’s not you anymore. Or if it’s not your story, I feel like it’s not genuine anymore. People won’t be able to relate to your art, or it’s no longer natural.)\\n“Life is bigger than any of my thoughts,” Pablo added. “Itong gift na meron ako, technically hindi siya para sa akin. Itong gift na meron ako, para siya sa ibang tao. So parang puno or ‘yung DAM tree. Kung baga ‘pag nagbunga kami, ‘yung mga fruit na napaproduce namin, hindi sya technically for us, but for others. Kaya as much as possible, sinasabi ko ‘yung thoughts ko through our music. Sinasabi ko ‘yung mga gusto kong sabihin, ginagawa ko ‘yung gusto kong gawin.”\\n(This gift that I have, technically it’s not for me. This gift is for other people. Like a tree, or our DAM tree. When we bear fruit, the fruit is technically not for us, but for others. So as much as possible, I express my thoughts through our music. I say what I want to say, I do what I want to do.)\\nPablo said the collaborators they worked with for the EP were not necessarily “chosen” — in a way the songs chose the collaborators — since they prioritized choosing songs that tell their story.\\nThe members worked with different producers for different songs: Xerxes Bakker, Alawn, August Rigo, Simon Servida, and Josue of RADKIDZ all helped to complete the tracks.\\nJosh shared that the process for “8TonBall” felt enlightening for him. “Mas naging mahirap sa akin siguro ‘yung part na I’m trying to speak for the entire group or trying to write for the entire group, rather than just myself. Kasi syempre, iniisip ko talaga kung ano ‘yung gusto rin nilang sabihin, kung ano ‘yung ano yung gusto ng part — na parang para sa part na ito, ano kaya ‘yung bagay for this voice? Parang iniisip mo agad kung ano ‘yung part ni Justin, part ni Ken, part ni Stell, ‘yung mga ganon,” he added.\\n(What was more challenging for me was the part where I’m trying to speak for the entire group or trying to write for the entire group, rather than just myself. Of course, I was thinking about what they wanted to say. Or what part they want to sing. For example, whose voice would be most suitable for this certain part? It’s like I was already thinking which will be Justin’s part, or Ken’s, or Stell’s.)\\nMain dancer Ken, who has a prolific discography under his solo project FELIP, also talked about how “Quit” was supposed to be a solo song. “The song was pretty much done.

And then, after we have selected the songs to include in this EP, we had to change the arrangements of the song because it has to fit the group.)\\nWith the EP released on April 25, the group also put out the music video for “Time.” Described as an “anthemic ballad,” it talked about how things may pass, as nothing is permanent. \\nIn a statement, SB19 said, “Time will run out soon.

It felt like the right time to show people that we can do this now — that this is where SB19 is,” the P-pop group said.\\nStell, the group’s main vocalist, expressed his excitement to perform these songs for the fans. “Kapag with dance, excited ako i-perform ‘yung ‘DUNGKA!’ Pero when it comes to kanta-kanta, parang excited ako sa ‘Time,’” he said.\\n(If you’re asking me in terms of dance or performance, I’m excited to perform “DUNGKA!” But when it comes to singing, I’m excited for “Time.”)\\nAnother part of the EP release is the infamous DAM Tree installed in Bonifacio Global City in Taguig.

In an interview with Rappler, the group’s main vocalist Stell revealed the song reflects how today’s generation deals with inner struggles. “With this generation, sobrang naging woke lahat ng tao,” he said.\\n“So I guess, kahit na sabihin nating mababaw siya or malalim, it’s a battle. I think meron tayo noon deep inside us na hindi lang nakikita ng tao, but I guess everyone is living with his or her own war.”\\n(With this generation, everyone is woke. We may call it shallow or deep, but it’s a battle. We have that deep inside us that other people don’t see. Everyone is living with his or her own war.)\\nThe music is a combination of hiphop, Celtic folk, and EDM music — complemented by booming bass lines and high notes, especially at the bridge.\\nThe music video is set in a medieval world, complete with dark castles, sorcerers, warriors, ravens, and magic. All together, the visuals build up a sense of conflict and doom — with the key players turning into stone as they behold a golden fruit-bearing tree.\\nAsked about the concept for the music video, the members said they harnessed ideas from everyone. Pablo explained that though they had an initial blueprint for the music and sound, making everyone’s ideas come to life was a challenging process.\\nKen, SB19’s main dancer, likened the process to infinity — using his hands to do the talking — where the beginning is the end, and the end is the beginning.\\n“Pinaka-ayaw namin na gagawin namin na naka-costume kami pero ang corny tingnan. Dapat parang Marvel ‘to, ‘yun ang benchmark…Kung kunwari warrior ka, dapat whole look mo, actions mo — it exudes warrior. Kailangan cohesive, and at the same time, hindi cringey,” Pablo explained.\\n(We would hate it if we would wear costumes and look corny. It should look like a Marvel movie, that’s the benchmark…For example, if one will play a warrior, your whole look and actions should exude a warrior. It should be cohesive, and at the same time, not cringey.)\\nMain rapper Josh added that their tendency to micromanage was, as usual, a hurdle in itself. He credited the teams they worked with for the final output — that despite sleepless nights — they are very happy with the work they deem their most ambitious.\\n“DAM’s” release also signals the start of the group’s new era for its new EP Simula at Wakas. SB19 says it is the last installment in a trilogy, following Pagsibol in 2021 and Pagtatag in 2023.\\nWith a childish grin, Justin — the group’s creative director — explained their take on the paradox of opposites, “‘Yung ipinakita namin ngayon sa ‘DAM’ is not actually the end. Or it might be the end of a specific start.” \\n“So, kumbaga, every time – yung kagaya na sinasabi ng kanta – ‘pag nagsisimula ka, nagtatapos siya…It’s up to the viewers kung paano nila hahanapin ‘yung sagot, or iintindihin, or kung paano nila idi-dissect ‘yung buong flow. Hindi ‘nyo alam ‘yung timeline niya, but every time we begin, we end it, but we begin again,” he added.\\n(What we showed with “DAM” is not actually the end. Or it might be the end of a specific part. So every time — like what was in the song — whenever you start something, it also ends…So, it’s up to the viewers how they will look for answers, understand, or dissect the flow. You don’t know the timeline, but every time we begin, we end it, but we begin again.)\\nThe other songs in Simula at Wakas will be released on April 13, and fans should expect more announcements from the multi-awarded P-pop group.\\nPablo teased, “Sobrang proud ako sa album na to. Kasi sobrang dami niyang layers na kapag pinakinggan mo bawat kanta, dadalhin ka talaga sa iba’t ibang lugar, iba’t ibang emosyon. And ‘yun ‘yung pinaka-proud ako kasi ang dami talagang tao na naging involved dito sa EP na ‘to.”\\n(I’m really proud of this album. It has so many layers that when you listen to each song, it will transport you to different places, make you feel different emotions. What makes me proud the most is the fact that a lot of people worked hard for this EP.)\\nKen also talked about their upcoming concert at the Philippine Arena on May 31, and the world tour that will follow. \\n“Ito ‘yung biggest tour namin na mangyayari. So I’m really excited for the fans to experience this,” he said. Gusto talaga namin na experience eh, hindi ‘yung parang manonood lang sila don. Gusto namin ‘yung parang dalhin namin sila sa kabilang sanlibutan.”\\n(This is the biggest tour that we will undertake. So, I’m really excited for the fans to experience this. We really want it to be an experience, not just a show for the fans. We want to transport them to another universe.)\\nAside from announced concert stops, Stell said there are more unannounced venues and shows. He asked fans to stay tuned for their updates.\\nThe group debuted in 2018, and has since received several awards and recognition. In 2021, the members are named Youth Ambassador of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) and Sentro Rizal, NCCA’s cultural center for overseas Filipinos.\\nThey are known for hits “GENTO,” “MAPA,” “Go Up!,” “Bazinga,” and “Nyebe,” among others. – Rappler.com\\n']\n",

      "[\"'We're humans, too': SB19 bares vulnerability in 'PAGTATAG!' documentary film\", 'https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/sb19-bares-vulnerability-pagtatag-documentary-film/', '2024-08-28T21:07:42+08:00', 'MANILA, Philippines – “It’s our first time to document the behind the scenes of our career.” SB19 leader Pablo said during the premiere night of PAGTATAG! The Documentary last Sunday, August 25 in Quezon City.\\nIt would be normal for the fans of the P-pop boy group to see the five members play games, go about their days, and hang out with each other, but the documentary film directed by Jed Regala went beyond their boys-next-door persona, and showed them as serious artists evolving their art.\\xa0\\nIt features what happened behind the scenes of the recently-concluded PAGTATAG! era – from the preparations for the kick-off concert, the Philippine tour, the tour in the United States and Canada, the legal hurdles they had with their group name, the canceled Asia shows, and the eventual resolution of the legal issues. \\nIt also shows how the group pushed through with the remaining Asia stops, and how they geared up for the PAGTATAG! finale concerts.\\nThe video footage shows the realities of touring – traveling without their full team, hauling suitcases from airports, sleeping in overnight buses and doing shows the next day. The documentary shows the members packing their own luggage, steaming their own clothes, and even minding their own outfit changes sans assistants during concert breaks.\\nDuring the talkback session after the premiere night, SB19’s main dancer Ken said he wanted fans to understand that they are “humans, too. ‘Yung ibang fans namin, tinitingala kami as perfect creatures. Pero dumadanas din po kami ng paghihirap, ‘yung struggles namin.”\\n(Some of our fans look at us as if we’re perfect creatures, but we’re not. We also have a hard time and we have struggles.)\\nThe film also shows how the travels and shows took a toll on the members physically. There was a time when Justin was not feeling well, but he still pushed himself to do the show. He is seen blowing his nose in between concert stages. There is a moment when Stell asks for Lola Remedios, a food supplement syrup that helps relieve throat discomfort or flu-like symptoms.\\xa0\\n“Mahilig talaga ako sa Lola [Remedios],” Stell even joked during the talkback session.\\n(I really like taking Lola Remedios.)\\nDuring the premiere night, Pablo shared how appreciative he was that the documentary team gave him private time when he would have his panic attack before the show starts. He said he had been struggling with anxiety and he needed time to calm himself during stressful situations.\\nJosh, meantime, talked in depth about the anxiety for their shows abroad. He admitted there was a time they had to “fake” confidence on tour, projecting a self-assurance they didn’t feel.\\n“Mahirap na pumunta ka sa ibang bansa, at kailangan na may impression kaming iwan sa kanila. Napakahirap po na fine-fake namin kahit sobrang mamamatay na kami sa anxiety and kaba bago mag-perform,” he shared during the premiere night.\\n(It’s hard to go abroad and you are pressured to leave a good impression there. It was so hard to fake it even though we were dying inside from the anxiety and nervousness before our performance.)\\nBut Josh also shared that he wanted fans to understand that “It’s possible to do the impossible – just look at us and where we are now.”\\nWhen the documentary screening was announced, fans assumed that the group will discuss the legal issues they went through in November 2023. It was an incredibly stressful time in SB19’s life as a band – it had come to a point when the group was not allowed to use their name. They were also forced to cancel several shows in their Asia tour, much to the fans’ dismay.\\nThe issue was settled in December, with the group saying it had an “amicable agreement” with ShowBT Philippines Corp, but the fans still had their own theories and conjectures.\\nSadly, the documentary did not help clear up the mystery – but fans understood the group would have been constrained by a non-disclosure agreement.\\nWhen asked if these issues affected the production of the film, director Jed Regala said, “It was the film’s plot twist that happened during the middle of things when everything’s so high up. That plot twist really took everyone by surprise.”\\n“During that time, sa sitwasyon namin, we don’t have the mind to ‘Magpa-video tayo, i-document ‘tong mga bagay na ‘to’,” Justin added.\\n(During that time, in that situation, we didn’t have the headspace to think about taking videos or documenting what was going on.)\\nThe five members were all in agreement that the legal battle made the PAGTATAG! era live up to its name – which means “strengthening.”\\nPablo admitted that what they went through gave him newfound courage – it bullet-proofed him against a whimsical and repetitive industry. He said he was able to see how hard they worked together and appreciated the people who were with them from the beginning.\\nAt the premiere night, Josh teased that “Simula At Wakas”, the next part of the group’s EP trilogy, is coming “very soon.” Justin happily shared their preparations has synergy with the title, and Pablo added they are taking their time to prepare for their next releases.\\nThe SB19 leader also said, in terms of the group’s artistry, SB19 always tries to explore “exciting” and “scary.”\\n“Hindi kami napipigilan ng ‘unknown’ from the very beginning kasi sigurado kami sa gusto namin, basta kasama namin ang supporters at team namin.”\\n(We never let the unknown hold us back from the very beginning, because we were sure of what we wanted to do and achieve. As long as our supporters and our team are behind us.)\\nPAGTATAG! The Documentary has a limited screening in cinemas in the Philippines from August 28 to September 1. – Rappler.com\\n']\n",
